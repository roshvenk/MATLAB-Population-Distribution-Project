# MATLAB-Population-Distribution-Project
This is an application that was developed by my team and I in our freshman year of college. The objective was to create an application that would determine the best cities for the user to relocate to based on his location. The application took into consideration a variety of factors such as the disease rate, unemployment, crime rates, and more. A more detailed report of the application can be found in the repository.
